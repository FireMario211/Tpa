# Tpa Plugin (Hytale)

A simple tpa plugin for your Hytale server! Technically it's a mod as well but it's meant for servers for players to easily teleport to others without needing permission. This takes inspiration from the other plugin.

# Commands
/tpa <Player> - Sends a teleportation request to a specified player.
/tpaccept - Accepts a teleportation request sent from a player.
/tpdeny - Denies a teleportation request sent from a player.
/tpcancel - Cancels an existing teleport request.
/tpatoggle - Toggle if players should be able to send a teleport request to you.

This is my first mod/plugin, report any issues you face!

# Build Instructions

git clone https://github.com/FireMario211/Tpa

```
